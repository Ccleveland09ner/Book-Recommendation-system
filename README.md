Thanks! Since I can’t access the GitHub repo directly right now due to a temporary issue, I’ll write a simplified and specific `README.md` based on the public info and common patterns in book recommendation repos.

You can paste this directly into your repo and edit minor parts (like file names or descriptions) if needed:
